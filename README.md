# Huffman-Compression-and-Decompression
An efficient implementation of Huffman algorithm 

*Users can compress and decompress any file type .

*users can choose N bytes to be grouped instead of only one byte 
so if we have many frequent repeated contacted bytes the compression will
be more efficient in case of speed and encoded file size.

*My implementation runs compression and decompression of a 473 MB file
only in less than 2 minutes.
